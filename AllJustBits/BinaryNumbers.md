# Binary, Bytes, and Bitwise Operators in Python

## Overview

- Computer processors are everywhere
- CPUs are built on transistors which are small switches
- Everything in a computer is represented by a series of switches that are either on or off
- Binary numbers are used to represent switches
- 1 for on
- 0 for off

## Bitwise
- Bitwise operations are used to combine or change one or more binary numbers
- z= x AND y
    - true (1) is both x & y are true
- z= x OR y
    - true (1) if either x or y is true
- z= x XOR y
    - true (1) if only one of x or y is true
- z= NOT x
    - true (1) if x is false (0)
- z= x << n
    - bits in x are shifted left by n positions. New bits start as 0
- z= x >> n
    - same as above just to the right

# Binary Numbers

- 0 is false
- 1 is true
- Read binary use power of 2^0 from right to left
- Going left makes the number go bigger
- Base 10 is decimal (What we use)
- Base 2 is binary (What the computer uses)  
- Base 8 is octal (divide by 8 & write remainder to the right) 
- Base 16 is hex (goes into alphabet)
