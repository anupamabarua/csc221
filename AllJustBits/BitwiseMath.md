# Bitwise Math

## Bitwise Operations

- Effect one or more bits in a binary numbers
- AND
- OR
- XOR
- NOT
- Shifts

- Only 1 & 1 together make 1
- 1 ^ 0 = 1
- 0 ^ 1 = 1
- only 0 | 0 dosent equal to 1
- ~0 = 1
- ~1 = 0

- shift left<< or right >>

## Caveat Emptor

- computers use bianary to represent numbers
- everything so far have been unsigned and logical operations

## Number Representations

- Binary values are powers of 2 and only represent postive numbers
- Group of 8 bits is a Byte

Overflow
- if you add 1 to 10 it will go into a over flow

Sign Magnitude Intergers
- uses the left most bit to indicate postive or negative
- left most bit of 2 means a negative number
- cannot just add bits together
